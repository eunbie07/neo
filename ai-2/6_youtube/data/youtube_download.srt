1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,920
I have a confession to make, but first, I want you to make a little confession to me.

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,639
In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively

3
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:38,160
little stress. Anyone? How about a moderate amount of stress? Who's experienced a lot of stress?

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,799
Yeah, me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this. I'm a health psychologist,

5
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,919
and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier. But I fear that something I've

6
00:00:53,919 --> 00:01:01,759
been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress.

7
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,559
For years, I've been telling people stress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything

8
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:14,320
from the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,000
But I've changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours. Let me start with the

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,239
study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults in the

11
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:35,199
United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, how much stress have you experienced

12
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:44,480
in the last year? They also asked, do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?

13
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:53,440
And then they used public death records to find out who died. Okay. Some bad news first. People

14
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,559
who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43 per cent increased risk of dying.

15
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:10,800
But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,160
People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely

17
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,559
to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had

18
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:27,440
relatively little stress. Now, the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:35,679
tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress

20
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:45,119
is bad for you. That is over 20,000 deaths a year. Now, if that estimate is correct, that would

21
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:50,320
make believing stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:03:00,720
year, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV, AIDS, and homicide. You can see why the study

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,279
freaked me out. Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your

24
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:14,080
health. So this study got me wondering, can changing how you think about stress make you

25
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,600
healthier? And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress, you can change

26
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,160
your body's response to stress. Now, to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that

27
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,000
you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test.

28
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:38,559
You come into the laboratory and you're told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech

29
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,039
on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you,

30
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,679
and to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face,

31
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:57,520
kind of like this, and the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging non-verbal

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:13,360
feedback, like this. Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two, a math test.

33
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,519
And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.

34
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,760
Now, we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun for me. Okay.

35
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:33,839
I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven. You're going to do this

36
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:44,720
out loud as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go. Go faster. Faster, please. You're going too

37
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,720
slow. Stop, stop, stop, stop. That guy made a mistake. We're going to have to start all over

38
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,119
again. You're not very good at this, are you? Okay. So, you get the idea. Now, if you were

39
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:01,920
actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out. Your heart might be pounding. You

40
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,200
might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat. And normally, we interpret these

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,239
physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.

42
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:19,200
But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet

43
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,640
this challenge? Now, that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted

44
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,480
at Harvard University. Before they went through the social stress test, they were taught to rethink

45
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,640
their stress response as helpful. That pounding heart is preparing you for action. If you're

46
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,640
breathing faster, it's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain. And participants who

47
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,920
learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed

48
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,679
out, less anxious, more confident. But the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical

49
00:05:53,679 --> 00:06:00,160
stress response changed. Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood

50
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,519
vessels constrict like this. And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes

51
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,000
associated with cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.

52
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,880
But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful,

53
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,359
their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding, but this is a

54
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:29,600
much healthier cardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy.

55
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:38,959
And courage. Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change

56
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,720
could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your

57
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,600
90s. And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress

58
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,519
matters. So my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to get rid of your

59
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:04,399
stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention. If you raised

60
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,640
your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life.

61
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,000
Because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,200
this talk, and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me rise to this challenge.

63
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,079
And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes

64
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:36,160
healthier. Now, I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from,

65
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,119
so we are going to do one more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most

66
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:48,000
underappreciated aspects of the stress response, and the idea is this. Stress makes you social.

67
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,000
To understand the side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin. And I know,

68
00:07:54,559 --> 00:08:00,000
oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname,

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,760
the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone. But this is a very small part

70
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:13,440
of what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neurohormone. It fine-tunes your brain's social

71
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:22,480
instincts. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes

72
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,399
you crave physical contact with your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even

73
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,559
makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about. Some people have even

74
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,280
suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring.

75
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:50,159
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone.

76
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,039
Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part of

77
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:03,760
your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. And when oxytocin is released

78
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,400
in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stress response is

79
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,840
nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants to

80
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,960
make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each

81
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:31,039
other. When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care

82
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:38,400
about you. Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier? Well, oxytocin

83
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,799
doesn't only act on your brain, it also acts on your body. And one of its main roles in your body

84
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:52,640
is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. It's a natural anti-inflammatory.

85
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,200
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress. But my favourite effect on the

86
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,039
body is actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone. And oxytocin helps

87
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:13,679
heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage. This stress hormone strengthens

88
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:20,960
your heart. And the cool thing is, is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced

89
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,599
by social contact and social support. So when you reach out to others under stress, either to seek

90
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:33,520
support or to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes

91
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,799
healthier, and you actually recover faster from stress. I find this amazing that your stress

92
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:48,719
response has a built-in mechanism for stress resilience. And that mechanism is human connection.

93
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:56,080
I want to finish by telling you about one more study. And listen up, because this study could

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,320
also save a life. This study tracked about a thousand adults in the United States, and they

95
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,679
ranged in age from 34 to 93. And they started the study by asking, how much stress have you

96
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:18,479
experienced in the last year? They also asked, how much time have you spent helping out friends,

97
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:25,039
neighbors, people in your community? And then they used public records for the next five years to

98
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:33,119
find out who died. Okay, so the bad news first. For every major stressful life experience, like

99
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:41,840
financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30%. But, and I

100
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:48,799
hope you are expecting a but by now, but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time

101
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:58,400
caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience.

102
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:05,760
And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable.

103
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:14,080
How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view

104
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:23,919
your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect

105
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:33,440
with others under stress, you can create resilience. Now, I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful

106
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,840
experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.

107
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning

108
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,599
in connecting with others. And yes, your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength

109
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:05,840
and energy. And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress,

110
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,119
you're actually making a pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself to

111
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:22,000
handle life's challenges. And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone. Thank you.

112
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Thank you.

113
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,039
I mean, this is kind of amazing what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me that a belief

114
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,039
about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy. How would that extend

115
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,320
to advice? Like if someone's making a lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job and a

116
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,799
non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go? That it's equally wise to go for the

117
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,159
stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense?

118
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,559
Yeah. And one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than

119
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,280
trying to avoid discomfort. And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions,

120
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,440
is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle

121
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,799
the stress that follows. Thank you so much, Kelly.

122
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:16,799


123
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:28,799
That's really cool.
